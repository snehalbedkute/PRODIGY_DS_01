# PRODIGY_DS_01

**Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this task is worldpopulationdata.csv. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

**Tools and Libraries used**
Jupyter notebook
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

This project focuses on analyzing global population data using a dataset containing country-wise population statistics. The notebook begins by loading and exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, duplicates, and understanding its structure. It then filters the data to focus specifically on total population figures, identifies the top ten most populous countries in the year 2022, and visualizes the results using bar plots. The analysis is carried out using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for efficient data handling and visualization.
